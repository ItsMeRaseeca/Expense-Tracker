# Expense Tracker App  

This **Expense Tracker** is designed to help users record, analyze, and visualize their expenses efficiently. The app allows users to enter item details, calculate total costs, and generate statistical insights such as **mean, median, and mode**. It also provides a **bar chart visualization** for better financial tracking.  


### Python  
Python serves as the core programming language for this project. It is responsible for handling the logic behind adding, clearing, and analyzing expenses, as well as managing the integration of various libraries used for data manipulation, visualization, and GUI creation.  

### Tkinter  
Tkinter is used to build the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application. It provides interactive elements such as input fields, buttons, and labels, allowing users to input expense details and view results in an organized layout. The framework ensures a smooth user experience while interacting with the application.  

### Pandas  
Pandas is utilized for efficient data handling and processing. It structures the entered expense details into a DataFrame, enabling organized storage and manipulation of data. This allows for easier statistical calculations and analysis of expenses.  

### Matplotlib  
Matplotlib is responsible for generating visual representations of the recorded expenses. The application uses it to create a bar chart that helps users identify spending patterns at a glance. By displaying the total cost of each item visually, it enhances financial tracking and decision-making.  

### SciPy (scipy.stats)  
SciPy is used for statistical analysis of expenses. The `scipy.stats` module calculates key financial insights such as mean, median, and mode, giving users a better understanding of their spending habits. This analysis helps in identifying common expense trends and outliers.
